Tree-beetle interaction data collection:
----------------------------------------
The experiment underlying the data was conducted by Vogel and colleagues in the Steigerwald forest located in northern Bavaria, Germany (49째32' N; 10째23' E). The Steigerwald forest covers around 16,500 ha of forests from colline up to sub-montane mountain range with a mean annual temperature around 8째C and an annual precipitation around 750 to 800 mm (forest climate station Ebrach). Temperatures higher than 8째C are reached on about 160 days per year. 
In 2015, six study sites (Plot A-F) were established. This dataset includes the data based on two subplots within each plot: (1) open habitat (sun-exposed on a forest meadow), and (2) closed habitat (canopy-shaded within a closed forest stand). Freshly cut logs and branch bundles of six tree species (Abies alba, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Populus tremula and Quercus petraea) were exposed on each subplot. 
Deadwood objects were sampled for saproxylic beetles using stem emergence traps. With this sampling technique it is possible to collect emerging individuals, developing in deadwood, while excluding other occasional visitors. Traps were filled with saturated saline solution as sampling fluid and emptied monthly between April and September in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Beetles were classified as saproxylic according to Schmidl and Bussler.

Details for: R_code.R
---------------------------------------

* Description: Main code for plotting all figures.

* Format(s): .R

* Size(s): 13.8 KB

* Dimensions: 356 lines

* Before using the R_code.R, you must download the package "iNEXT.3D", "iNEXT.4steps", "iNEXT.beta3D", and "iNEXT.link" from Anne Chao's Github.
* Because this code runs a random bootstrapping process in the background, with default = 100 replications/loops, to estimate standard error, the output (for se and 95% confidence intervals) will vary very slightly each time you enter the same data. Also, the bootstrap procedure is VERY time-consuming; please change the argument nboot = 100 (default) in any function to nboot = 0 (to skip the bootstrap process), or nboot = 20 (to roughly browse the resulting confidence intervals).
